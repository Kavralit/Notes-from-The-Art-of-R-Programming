### Intro to R Markdown, Variables, and Vectors

In R Markdown, we start our code with three apostrophes, followed by the programming language in brackets.
Then we enter our code.
Then we end the code segment by using  a line with three apostrophes.

In this example, we define a variable to be equal to 10:

```{r}
y<-10
y
```
The most common data structure in R is the Vector, which is an ordered set of numbers.
We can define this by using the concatenate operator, 'c,' to concatenate several numbers:

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,9,10,10)
```


Many functions also return vectors, which can be useful in simulation exercises.
Here, we pull 1 randomly generated variable, then 4, then 8:
```{r}
rnorm(1)
rnorm(4)
rnorm(8)
```


### Histograms
Many functions will take vectors as input.
For example, we can send normally generated variables to the histogram function (HIST).


```{r}
hist(rnorm(1))
hist(rnorm(10))
hist(rnorm(100))
hist(rnorm(1000))
```


We can also build a histogram from the vector we defined earlier:

```{r}
x
hist(x)

```

That looks terrible!  Histograms, how do they work?
You can use the ? command to retrieve the manual page and learn more about it:

```{r}
?hist
```


Ok we got it.
The problem is that we didn't define the width of the bins.
In R, the bins are defined by their endbpoints, with the 'breaks' variable.
The example from the help screen uses the sequence ('seq') function to define the 'breaks' variable with a sequence of integers from the minimum to the maximum.

We can learn more about sequences:
```{r}
?seq
```

We can even ask for an example:
```{r}
example(seq)
```

Let's use seq, and we'll save his histogram for later:

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,9,10,10)
hist(x, breaks = seq(from=min(x), to=max(x),by=1))
histx <- hist(x, breaks = seq(from=min(x), to=max(x),by=1))

```
Awesome!
We can use other functions on this vector:

```{r}
mean(x)
sd(x)

```

### Functions and Variables


We've covered how to use the HIST function.
We can also write our own functions.

Note that when we define a variable within a function, it remains a local variable.
If it is defined outside of a function, it becomes a global variable.


We'll follow an example from the book, but first we'll cover Return and the modulo operator.

We use 'Return' to explicitly return the value that we're calculating.
So here, no matter what we enter, the function returns 'Hello World.'

```{r}
HelloWorld <- function(x)
{return('Hello World')}

```

And voila:
```{r}
HelloWorld(x)
```

An example from the book uses the modulo function (%%).
This works like we would expect:

```{r}
c(10,20,30) %% 10
c(11,21,31) %% 10
c(12,22,32) %% 10

```


This function from the textbook counts odd numbers within a vector.
```{r}
oddcount <- function(x) {
  k <- 0 #assign 0 to k

  for (n in x)  {
    if (n %% 2 == 1) k <- k+1 #if n module 2 equals one, then add 1 to counter k
  }
  return(k)
}

```  

Let's run it!

```{r}
x
oddcount(c(1,3,5))
oddcount(x)
```


### Matrices
So far, we've seen scalars, vectors, and strings.
R also has matrices.

You can build a matrix by combining rows, using the rbind command.
You can also combine columns, using the cbind command.

```{r}
mr <- rbind(c(1,2,3,4),c(10,20,30,40),c(100,200,300,400))
mr

```



```{r}
mc <- cbind(c(1,2,3,4),c(10,20,30,40),c(100,200,300,400))
mc

```

You can select a particular element, or row, or column
```{r}
mc[1,1]
mc[1,]
mc[,1]
```

We can send columns to RBind to make them rows:
```{r}
mr

rbind(mc[,1],mc[,2],mc[,3])

```



### Other Help Commands
We have used the help command and the explain command.
There is also structure (str) and attributes
```{r}
str(mr)
str(mc)
attributes(mc)

str(histx)
attributes(histx)

```

Here are additional examples of the example function:
```{r}

example(hist)

```

```{r}
example(persp)
```


### Actuarial Stuff

```{r}


```

## Original Documentation
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
